## I.	Overview

The Engineering contents is where the Innova Engineering team share their thoughts, ideas and experiences on various topics on Technology,Mathematics and Statistics and the Financial markets.
The Writings are intended to have at least 2 submissions after every 4weeks. Extra posts will still be posted if there are any. The editor(s) would be in charge of reviewing and posting the articles. 
One would be from the developers and the other from the Quants team. (Either Quants or dev can have a technical quant write up or the opposite as well)

## II. Structure of the Posts.

The team can reference the below outlines to guide in structuring their posts. 

1.)	Define Objective of the post

2.)	Proceed to the main idea of the post

3.)	Conclusion 

4.)	Citations/References  

## III. Guidelines

One key thing is to have references and links where some ideas have been borrowed from and also help the reader if they so wish to dive deeper into the subject\topic. 

The second idea is be as granular as possible in the explanation of the concepts and provide code samples where necessary. 

Hyperlinks can be added to relevant supporting materials.

The writing would be posted every last week of the month and should be submitted by the end of third week of the Month for review.  

Final guideline would be to avoid copying from other sources if itâ€™s necessary highlight the source and acknowledge their work. This is to encourage originality as much.
